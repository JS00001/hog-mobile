## Introduction

Hog Mobile is a free and open-source [PostHog](https://posthog.com) client for mobile devices. The app allows users to view their PostHog dashboards, events, and more. This repository contains the code for the Hog Mobile app. The app does not have a custom backend, but rather, directly communicates with [PostHog's](https://posthog.com/) API.

## Architecture

| Folder       | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@types`     | Common data types used across the entire application.                                                                          |
| `api`        | All methods to call PostHog's backend API exist here.                                                                          |
| `app`        | Expo router root folder.                                                                                                       |
| `components` | Larger components made up of smaller components from the `ui` folder, such as Widgets, Bottom Sheets, etc.                     |
| `constants`  | Constant values used across the entire application.                                                                            |
| `hooks`      | Common hooks across the application. Includes an `api` folder with hooks for every API query and mutation using Tanstack Query |
| `lib`        | Utility functions and external library setup.                                                                                  |
| `providers`  | Context providers for the application.                                                                                         |
| `store`      | Client-side stores using Zustand. _Preferred over using React Context_                                                         |
| `ui`         | Small blocks of UI components such as Buttons, Inputs, etc.                                                                    |

### Managing Server State

All async state should be handled via Tanstack Query. Every API query and mutation has an associated hook in the `hooks/api` folder. The hooks should be used in the components to fetch and mutate data. The hooks are responsible for managing the state and fetching the data from PostHog's backend.

Relevant optimistic updates or cache updates (when mutating data) should be handled in the hooks.

Every component using a query should validate `isLoading`, `isError`, and `data` states to handle the UI accordingly.

## Debugging

To help with debugging, we've added debugging tools to the application when running in development mode.
